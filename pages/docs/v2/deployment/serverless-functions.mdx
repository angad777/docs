ZEIT Now deployments support various backend languages that you can deploy as Serverless functions.

## Deploying Serverless Functions

To deploy serverless functions without any additional configuration, you can put files using backend languages in an `api` directory in your project's root.

Then, using [Now CLI](/download), run the following command to deploy from your terminal:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Deploying a project with Now CLI in one command.</Caption>

### Deploying a Node.js API

For an example of creating a Node.js API with serverless functions, create a `name.js` file in the `api` directory at your project's root, with the following code which recieves a name query string and returns a string when requested:

```js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  const { name = 'World' } = req.query
  res.send(`Hello ${name}!`)
}
```

Then, all you need to do to have a live API is to deploy with [Now CLI](/download) from your terminal:

<TerminalInput>now</TerminalInput>
<Caption>One-command deployment with <GenericLink href="/download">Now CLI</GenericLink>.</Caption>

The resulting deployment will contain your Node.js endpoint as a serverless function and will provide you with a URL like the following, with your API ready to go: <https://node-api.now-examples.now.sh/api/name?name=all>

<Note>
  For more information on how Node.js works with ZEIT Now, view the technical{' '}
  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/advanced/builders/node-js-now-node">
    reference for the base
  </GenericLink>
  .
</Note>

### Deploying a Go API

To create an API with serverless Go functions in your ZEIT Now deployments, you can provide an exported function like the following, cohesive with the `net/http` Go API:

```go
package handler

import (
        "fmt"
        "net/http"
)

func Handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "<h1>Hello from Go on Now!</h1>")
}
```

Then, deploying with Now CLI with the `now` command from your terminal will result in a serverless Go function and with a link like the following: <https://go-api.now-examples.now.sh/api/hello>

<Note>

  <GenericLink href="/docs/v2/advanced/builders/go-now-go">
    reference for the runtime
  </GenericLink>
  .
</Note>

### Deploying a Python API

To create an API with serverless Python functions in your ZEIT Now deployments, you can provide an exported function like the following, with `handler` defined:

```python
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler
from datetime import datetime

class handler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):

  def do_GET(self):
    self.send_response(200)
    self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/plain')
    self.end_headers()
    self.wfile.write(str(datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')).encode())
    return
```

Then, deploying with Now CLI with the `now` command from your terminal will result in a serverless Go function and with a link like the following: <https://python-api.now-examples.now.sh/api/date>

<Note>

### More Examples

For more examples on applications you can deploy with serverless functions, see the [ZEIT Now examples repository on GitHub](https://github.com/zeit/now-examples).

You can use any of the examples from the ZEIT Now examples repository by using the following command from [Now CLI](/download) in your terminal, then choosing an application to start with:

<TerminalInput>now init</TerminalInput>
<Caption>Initializing a project with Now CLI.</Caption>

## Local Development

Now provides an additional command with Now CLI to help you develop serverless functions locally by replicating the production environment from Now on your localhost.

If you have an `api` directory like the [above examples](#deploying-serverless-functions) on this page, you can run the following command to start a local development environment that supports your serverless API and allows you to develop locally:

<TerminalInput>now dev</TerminalInput>
<Caption>starting a local development environment using Now CLI, for serverless functions.</Caption>

<Note>
  The <InlineCode>now dev</InlineCode> command is still in beta. If you have any
  feedback,{' '}
  <GenericLink href="https://zeit.co/feedback/dev">
    please let us know
  </GenericLink>
  .
</Note>

If you have a statically generated frontend that supports its own development environment, such as Next.js, we recommend creating a `dev` script within a `package.json` file at the root of your project that `now dev` can use and extend:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next"
  }
}
```

## Advanced Usage

For an advanced configuration and structure, you can use a `now.json` file to set up [Builds](/docs/v2/advanced/builds) to configure your own structure and behaviour.

We do, however, recommend sticking to the `api` directory to keep things simple for your project.
