| Concept                                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Lifecycle](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lifecycle)                                     | The lifecycle of a deployment determines its readiness to accept user requests and serve traffic. Read more about how deployments go through phases to ensure they are served with maximum potential. |
| [Immutability](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/immutability)                               | Now deployments are immutable. Read more about this concept to see how it helps scale projects.                                                                                                       |
| [URLs](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/urls)                                               | Now Deployments are always assigned their own unique URLs and staging aliases. Read more about how they are formatted and how they work.                                                              |
| [Special Paths](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/special-paths)                             | Now Deployments always have two special pathnames; `/_src` and `/_logs`. Read more about what they are and how they help with your deployments workflow.                                              |
| [Lambdas](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/lambdas)                                         | Now outputs dynamic files as serverless Lambdas. Read more about how Lambdas work for your deployments and the benefits of serverless.                                                                |
| [CDN and Global Distribution](/docs/v2/deployments/concepts/cdn-and-global-distribution) | Now comes with a fully-featured and automatic CDN for deployments. Read more about how it works.                                                                                                      |
