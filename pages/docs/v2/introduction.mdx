ZEIT Now is a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. It enables developers to host websites and web services that deploy instantly, scale automatically, and require no supervision, all with no configuration.

This documentation contains all of the resources needed to **get up and running with Now**. Get started with some of the features of Now below and explore the documentation in their sections to learn how to make serverless deployments work for you.

### Try Now

The following example highlights the ease with which you can deploy static sites (like a new [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app) combined with a serverless function that can produce a dynamic response.

<Introduction />

Deploy the simple application above and get instantly redirected to your new deployment. Edit the code to see your changes live and then get started with your applications locally using the same power.

### Get Started

To learn more and get the most out of Now we recommend that you install [Now CLI](https://zeit.co/download).

They will give you complete control over your account and enable you to instantly [deploy applications](/docs/v2/deployments/basics), [assign custom domain names](/docs/v2/domains-and-aliases/aliasing-a-deployment) and much more.
