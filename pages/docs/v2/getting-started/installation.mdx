### Now CLI

The Now CLI is [open-source](https://github.com/zeit/now-cli) and distributed as binaries. It is very frequently updated and embeds helpful documentation on how to use it.

To verify it's installed and get started, run:

<TerminalInput>now help</TerminalInput>

Run the following command to log in with your ZEIT account through Now CLI:

<TerminalInput>now login</TerminalInput>

<Note>
  With <GenericLink href="#now-desktop">Now Desktop</GenericLink> installed, you
  can skip these instructions. Now CLI is packaged with Now Desktop and syncs
  login information and context between both clients. We encourage you to enable
  the option from within Now Desktop to install and keep your Now CLI up to
  date.
</Note>

#### From npm

We distribute the [Now CLI Binaries](#from-binaries) via `npm`, for convenience and ease of distribution. If you already have `npm`, which comes with Node.js, you can run:

<TerminalInput>npm i -g now</TerminalInput>

### Now for GitHub and GitLab
